# About
Our project is a website created for the University of Florida Table Tennis Club. The website is to serve as a 
way for students who are interested in the club to learn more by viewing pages such as the home page, which 
provides visitors with a general introduction to the club and allows them to view recent announcements posted by 
admins of the website. Another purpose of the website is to provide club officers with the ability to set up and 
manage tournaments, upload and delete photos on the photo page, and post, edit and delete announcements which will 
be displayed on the home page. The website will be hosted via Amazon web hosting services to allow for anyone to access 
the content of the website. The server functionality is run through Node.js and information is stored via MongoDB. 
Overall, this website will allow for an all encompassing experience for all table tennis club members, officers and users 
who are interested in the club.
